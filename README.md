# CS-122-Computer-Programming-2---Projects-Exercises-Repository

## Description

This repository marks the continuation of my programming education journey in CS 122 - Computer Programming 2, during my second semester at **Saint Louis University**. It showcases my advancement into more complex aspects of Java programming, emphasizing the design and implementation of user-defined reference classes, inheritance, exception handling, and more, reflecting a deeper understanding and application of Java programming principles.

## Contents & Learning Journey

### Prelim Period
#### 1. **User-Defined Reference Classes**
   - **Key Learnings**: Designing and implementing custom reference classes for various applications.
   - **Project Insight**: Creation of Java classes that encapsulate specific behaviors and attributes.
   - **Resources**: Consulted various Java programming guides and Oracle's official documentation.

#### 2. **Array and UML Class Diagrams**
   - **Key Learnings**: Utilizing arrays in conjunction with user-defined classes and understanding UML diagrams for class relationships.
   - **Project Insight**: Implementing applications that use arrays of objects and designing UML diagrams to represent class hierarchies.
   - **Resources**: Studied UML documentation and Java programming textbooks.

### Midterm Period
#### 3. **Inheritance and Exception Handling**
   - **Key Learnings**: Leveraging inheritance to create a well-organized class structure and implementing exception handling for robust applications.
   - **Project Insight**: Developing Java applications that demonstrate the use of inheritance and try-catch blocks to manage errors gracefully.
   - **Resources**: Detailed study of Java’s official tutorials and advanced programming books.

#### 4. **File Input/Output (I/O)**
   - **Key Learnings**: Working with Java’s I/O framework to read from and write to files.
   - **Project Insight**: Building applications that process text files, including reading data, processing it, and outputting results.
   - **Resources**: Oracle's Java I/O tutorials and related programming resources.

### Finals Period
#### 5. **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming**
   - **Key Learnings**: Integration of interfaces, abstract classes, generics, and the Java Collections Framework.
   - **Project Insight**:
      - Developing complex applications that use interfaces and abstract classes to provide a flexible framework.
      - Leveraging generics to create type-safe collections and utilizing the Java Collections Framework for efficient data manipulation.
   - **Resources**: Advanced studies in Java programming guides and Oracle documentation.

## Methodologies

- Advanced **Online Discussions** and **Interactive Demonstrations** for deep theoretical understanding.
- **Hands-on Programming Exercises** focusing on complex problem-solving and application development.
- Comprehensive **Assessments** through detailed programming tasks, incorporating advanced Java features to demonstrate proficiency.
